# Advanced Flask Chatbot — Version 2.0

> This repository is a technical presentation and documentation repository.  
> It does not contain downloadable source code or production files.

A complete project to build your own **Flask-based conversational assistant**, ready to run:  

- **locally (localhost)**  
- **on shared hosting such as o2switch (Passenger / cPanel)**

No external database, no hidden dependencies. You can use it as-is, modify it, or integrate it into another website or API.

---

## Overview

This project provides a self-hosted conversational assistant built with Flask,  
designed for developers and teams who want full control over their chatbot’s behavior and deployment.

The architecture prioritizes:  

- a local knowledge base (JSON) as the primary source  
- predictable behavior in professional environments  
- optional AI integration (OpenAI)  
- simple deployment without dependency on external SaaS platforms

## Key Features

- **Compatible with o2switch / Passenger (shared hosting)**  
- **No database required** (JSON-based operation)  
- **Readable, well-commented and easily customizable code**  
- **CORS enabled:** usable with websites or frontend interfaces  
- **Integrated logging system:** errors automatically recorded in `/logs/`

---

## Typical Use Cases

This chatbot is designed for:  

- internal knowledge assistants  
- support or documentation automation  
- self-hosted AI assistants  
- internal tools requiring controlled responses  
- websites embedding a chatbot widget

The system can operate fully offline using a local knowledge base,  
or optionally use OpenAI when extended responses are required.

---

## Automatically Generated Files

When the chatbot is launched for the first time, some files are created automatically:  

| File              | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `data.db`         | SQLite database storing conversations (if `ENABLE_PERSISTENCE=true`) |
| `logs/errors.log` | Created only when a server error occurs |
| `.env`            | Must be created from `.env.example` to enable OpenAI |

---

## Operating Modes

| Mode | Description | Requires OpenAI Key |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Local JSON** (default) | Responses generated from the local knowledge base | No |
| **OpenAI GPT (optional)** | Uses OpenAI API when a key is provided | Yes |

The mode is automatically selected depending on the presence of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in `.env`.  
No tokens are consumed if no key is provided.

---

## Error Logs

The `logs/` directory automatically records Flask server errors:  

- automatic creation of `logs/errors.log` when an error occurs  
- automatic creation of the `logs/` directory if missing  
- recording of date, error message and full traceback

This system works:  

- in local mode  
- with or without OpenAI  
- in production (Passenger / shared hosting)
