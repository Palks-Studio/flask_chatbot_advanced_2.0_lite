# Flask Chatbot – Advanced Professional Template (Version 2.0)

A complete project to create your own **conversational assistant with Flask**, ready to use:
- **locally (localhost)**

- **No database required** (JSON file only)
- **Readable, commented code, easily customizable**
- **CORS enabled:** can be used with a website or front-end interface
- **Built-in logging system:** errors automatically recorded in `/logs/` folder

## Automatically Generated Files

When you run the chatbot for the first time, some files are automatically created:

| File           | Purpose                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `data.db`      | SQLite database that stores conversations (created automatically if `ENABLE_PERSISTENCE=true`) |
| `logs/errors.log` | Created only if a server error occurs |
| `.env`         | Must be created manually from `.env.example` if you want to enable OpenAI |

⚠ **These files are not included in the project archive.**

---

## Operating Modes

| Mode                     | Description                                                              | Requires OpenAI Key |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Local JSON** (default) | Responses are generated from the `sample_data.json` file                 | No                   |
| **OpenAI GPT** (optional)| Uses the ChatGPT API if an API key is provided in the `.env` file        | Yes                  |

The mode is automatically selected based on whether the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable is present in the `.env` file.
No token usage occurs if no key is provided.

---

## Error Logs

The `logs/` folder is used to automatically record Flask server errors.
- The file `logs/errors.log` is created automatically if an error occurs.
- The `logs/` folder is generated if it does not exist (no need to create it manually).
- Each error entry contains:
  - the date and time
  - the error message
  - the full traceback for easier debugging

This system works in:
- local mode
- with or without OpenAI
- production (Passenger / shared hosting)
